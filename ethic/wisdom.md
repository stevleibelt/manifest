While you are living, you are juggling with four balls.
Three of them are made out of glas. The last one is a tennis ball. Three out of glas. That implies that they are breaking if you let them falling down. The fourth one, the tennis ball, does not break, even if you let him falling down. When the tennis ball is falling down, it will comes up again.

Now what are this balls standing for?
The three glass balls are are:
* your health
* your familiy
* your friends

The fourth ball represents your job.

So my advice for your live is, concentrate on the three glas balls in live. Never let one of them hit the ground.
